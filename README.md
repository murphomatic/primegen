# Prime Number Generator
This is just a simple tool for fun tinkering.

You may clone and run this directly in your browser from the local file system.  Primes are generated in Javascript and UI features are provided by Foundation.  Angular is used for some simple services and a controller.

Simply clone and open the index.html page.  Input the number seconds you wish to generate primes for, and click the "Go" button.  The output will display the total numbers evaluated, total primes found and largest prime found in the number of seconds you indicated.
